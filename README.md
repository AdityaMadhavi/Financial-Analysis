# Financial-Analysis
This is the list of Financial Analysis that I have successfully implemented, I used IDEA Software for performing data import, data cleaning, then summarizing the data according to my analysis. Also I used various joins to Map data for example ( Employee Master VS Salary register ). Also I had automated the process by creating scripts for more common analysis which saved around 350+hours of resource.
